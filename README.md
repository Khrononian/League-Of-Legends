With this app, you can explore player stats, match history, champion data and ranked stats pulled from Riot Games' official API. The app also has multiple pages including a player search for the summoner in the NA region with profile insights. The app also uses a Google Cloud to store the api key to prevent any users from accessing the key. 
Features include: 
* Summoner search
* Displays current rank, tier, LP, win/loss ratios and KDA
* Recent match hitory list with game mode, outcome, duration, champion played and match stats
* [Live Link](https://leagueanalytics.netlify.app/)

## Challenges
- Implementing firebase and working with a bit of Node in order to hide my API key took a lot of trial and error. Especially since I never worked with this as of yet.
- Having an item list that shows a brief description when you hover on it was difficult to make. Specifically making sure that when hovered, the box of information is
responsive and moves to its position relative to the screen.
